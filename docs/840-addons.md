# Add-ons

## Generality

This documentation is only about mfext "core" module.

**But there are some important *add-ons* available.**

You can use them exactly in the same way and with the same concepts (layers, components...).

An add-on can be *official* (i.e., it is maintained by the MetWork team) or *unofficial* (i.e., it is **not** maintained by the MetWork team).

Official ones are available in standard MetWork package repositories, so you can install them exactly
in the same way than for other non default layers. The only difference is that the corresponding source code and documentation are managed in a dedicated repository (for maintenance reasons).

Unofficial ones are not distributed by the MetWork project, so you will have probably to configure some extra repository to get them available through your favorite package management tool.

In all cases, an *add-on* contain one or several extra layers and so plenty of components. Please, refer to the corresponding documentation
