{% block overview %}

The `core` layer includes core packages which are always available. The `core`
layer is loaded by default (as the :ref:`root layer <layer_root>`). It can therefore be seen as an
extension of the :ref:`root layer <layer_root>`.

The distinction between the two is solely due to technical constraints.
